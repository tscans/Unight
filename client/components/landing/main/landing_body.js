				  <p>
				  	Unight allows users to support and connect with organizations like never before. It is a platform where users can pay monthly tribute to businesses in exchange for better deals and coupons throughout the month. Users have the satisfaction of contributing guaranteed income to their organization of choice while also receiving a discount or special coupon during the month to encourage continued traffic.
Non contributing customers can still support the business by becoming a free member for the business and receive additional information about upcoming events and get better marked coupons at the business. 
Unsure whatâ€™s going on tonight? Look no further than Unight for all local events and deals on the main page of the app. The local church you became a member of is having a cookout. The bar down the street is offering 25% off drinks. A familiar band is playing at your old high school. Whatever it is, you can find it on Unight.
